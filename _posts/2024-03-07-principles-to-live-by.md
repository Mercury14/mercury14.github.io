I spent some time this year thinking about the sort of person that I want to be. From this I have crafted a set of principles that I regularly reflect on and try to live by:

+ Focus on the outcome but ensure you can enjoy or endure the journey.
 
+ Create a plan and stick to it - adjust only as the situation changes.
 
+ Recognise cravings and desires as just impressions that should be noticed, named and then allowed to pass.
 
+ Don't let yourself be controlled by the algorithm - it does not have your best interests at heart.
 
+ Train your body as though your life depends on it - it does – but don’t forget to incorporate recovery and relaxation.
 
+ Spend more time thinking deeply and systemically – reflect and share your thoughts with others.
 
+ Be curious and learn - but be prepared to change what you believe to be true.
 
+ Nurture and grow your relationships - be generous and patient with people.
 
+ Be a good ancestor – ensure your descendants have a future world worth inheriting.
