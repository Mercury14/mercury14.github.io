# Simon Bartlett

Simon is a management consultant, systemic thinker, and life-long learner. 

> "I am curious and keen to learn new things, but I am also aware of the need to be prepared to change what I believe to be true"

Simon is currently a Consulting Director with Gobeyond Partners (now part of Concentrix), where he leads large and complex transformation programmes. Over a number of years, Simon has worked in multiple sectors and with everything from large multi-national enterprises to smaller SME firms.

He recognises that many situations he encounters as part his consulting practice, are complex, inter-related, dynamic and uncertain and do not lead themselve to traditional improvement techniques or problem solving methodologies. This has led him to develop his systems thinking praxis (theory informed action). 

At an early age, he caught the technology bug (he remembers fondly his first experiences of writing computer programs on his school's RML-380Z). Ever since, sensibly applying technology to solve organisation challenges has been a key part of his armoury. Outside of work, He continues to write code (mainly using Python).
